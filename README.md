![license-image](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/generator-neonode.svg)

A Yeoman generator to scaffold an opinionated minimalistic MVC framework.

## Quick Start
First you need to install yeoman and neonode's generator:
```sh
$ npm install -g yo generator-neonode
```

Now run neonode's generator:
```sh
$ yo neonode
```

Just follow the instructions.

In this example we will use the name `neonode-app` for our project.

![yo neonode](https://monosnap.com/file/x3mDljcANVhI6mFpymHqJ7jpYuHZ2t.png)

If you don't set a project name it will create the project in the current directory.

`neonode` uses webpack to compile its assets, to do it run:
```sh
$ webpack -d
```
![webpack -d](https://monosnap.com/file/Qzwk2EdIGl9fbqBCzH3NQNh2sDYBWs.png)

And finally to start the server run:
```sh
$ npm start
```
![npm start](https://monosnap.com/file/v79NZt33GtqEUjBmvLNGXM8Q4I4XdU.png)

Now point your browser to `http://localhost:3000` you should see something like this:

## Structure

* `bin` executable files
* `config`
  * `config.js` general app configuration
  * `middlewares.js` This file specifies the middlewares and the order they will be loaded
  * `routeMapper.js` Here you will set the routes.
* `controllers` [Neon.js](http://azendal.github.io/neon/) classes to handle the web requests
* `lib` You'll put libraries here
  * `boot.js` Here you can add code or modules that needs to run after the controllers and models are loaded
* `log` Application logs go here, you will find different logs depending of the value of your NODE_ENV variable, the default is `development.log`
* `middlewares` [Express](http://expressjs.com/) middlewares go here.
* `migrations` [Knex](http://knexjs.org) generated migrations will be here.
* `models` This holds the [Krypton-ORM](https://github.com/sgarza/krypton/) classes that model and wrap the data stored in the application's database
* `public`  Like the public directory for a web server, this directory has web files that don't change, such as JavaScript files (public/js), graphics (public/img), stylesheets (public/css), and HTML files (public).
* `views` This holds the display [Thulium](https://github.com/freshout-dev/thulium/) templates to fill in with data from our application, convert to HTML, and return to the user's browser.
  * `layouts` Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the common header/footer method of wrapping views.

## Routing

Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).

The Router Mapper recognizes URLs and dispatches them to a controller's action. It can also generate paths and URLs, avoiding the need to hardcode strings in your views.

With [Route Mapper](https://github.com/trekjs/route-mapper) you can generate Rails Style Routing and RESTFul routes.

The following code is an example of a very basic route:

`config/routeMapper.js`

```javascript
var routeMapper = new RouteMapper();

routeMapper
  .root('Home#index')
  .get('/login', { to: 'Sessions#new', as: 'login' })
  .get('/logout', { to: 'Sessions#destroy', as: 'logout' })
  .post('/login', { to: 'Sessions#create', as: 'login' })
```

When a `neonode` application receives an incoming request for:

`GET /users/42`

It asks the route mapper to match it to a controller action. If the first matching route is:

```javascript
routeMapper.get('/users/:id', { to: 'Users#show' })
```

The request is dispatched to the `UsersController` show action with { id: '42' } in the req.params object.

You can also use **Resource Routing**

A resourceful route provides a mapping between HTTP verbs and URLs to controller actions. By convention, each action also maps to particular CRUD operations in a database. A single entry in the routing file, such as:

```javascript
routeMapper
  .resource('Users')
```

Creates seven different routes in your application, all mapping to the `UsersController`:

|HTTP Verb   	|Path   	|Controller#action   	|Used for   	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
|GET   	|/users   	|Users#index   	|display a list of all users   	|
|GET   	|/users/new   	|Users#new   	|return an HTML form for creating a new user   	|
|POST   	|/users   	|Users#create   	|create a new user   	|
|GET   	|/users/:id   	|Users#show   	|display a specific user   	|
|GET   	|/users/:id/edit   	|Users#edit   	|return an HTML form for editing a user   	|
|PATCH/PUT   	|/users/:id   	|Users#update   	|update a specific user   	|
|DELETE   	|/users/:id   	|Users#destroy   	|delete a specific user   	|

Take a look at [Route Mapper documentation](https://github.com/trekjs/route-mapper) for more options and examples.

Also read [Rails Routing Guide](guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html) since `Route Mapper` is based on `Rails Router`

## Middlewaes

Middleware are functions that have access to the express's request object (req), the express's response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
* Make changes to the request and the response objects.
* End the request-response cycle.
* Call the next middleware in the stack.

You can add more middlewares to the `middlewares/` directory and the `config/middlewares.js` registry, just follow the [express's middlewares pattern](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html). These middlewares are [express's application level middlewares](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html#middleware.application).

## Controllers

After routing has determined which controller to use for a request, your controller is responsible for making sense of the request and producing the appropriate output.

A controller can thus be thought of as a middle man between models and views. It makes the model data available to the view so it can display that data to the user, and it saves or updates data from the user to the model.

The controller's methods follow the same patter as Express router-level middlewares.

The naming convention of controllers favors pluralization of the last word in the controller's name. For example, ClientsController, SiteAdminsController, UsersController and so on.

### Before Actions

The `beforeActions` is a static class variable set in any controller that holds a set middlewares that are run before any specific controller method.

```javascript
var UsersController = Class('UsersController').inherits(BaseController)({
  beforeActions : [
    {
      before : ['_loadUser'], \\ An array of functions or current controller method names.
      actions : ['show', 'edit', 'update', 'destroy']
    }
  ],
  prototype : {
    _loadUser : function(req, res, next) {
      User.query().where('id', req.params.id).then(function(result) {
        res.locals.user = result[0];
        next()
      });
    },
    show: function(req, res, next) {
      res.format({
        json : function() {
          res.json(res.locals.user) // _loadUser method ran after show method, so req.locals.user is available here
        },
        html: function() {
          res.render('user/show.html') // same here, req.locals.user is available in the template.
        }
      });
    }
  }
});
```

Another examples:

```javascript
beforeActions : [
  {
    before : [
      '_loadUser', // This has to be the name of a method that exists in the same controller
      function(req, res, next) { // This is just a custom middleware
        res.locals.hi = 'hi';
        next()
      },
      neonode.controllers['Home']._authenticate // This is a method from another controller
    ],
    actions : ['show', 'edit', 'update', 'destroy']
  },
  {
    before : [function(req, res, next) { // This is another before action that will run after all the previous ones.
      req.user = res.locals.user
      next();
    }],
    actions : ['show']
  }
]
```

### Methods / Actions

A controller is a class which inherits from `BaseController` and has methods just like any other class. When your application receives a request, the routing will determine which controller and action to run, then Neonode gets that controller instance and runs the method with the same name as the action.

```javascript
var UsersController = Class('UsersController').inherits(BaseController)({
  prototype : {
    new: function(req, res, next) {

    }
  }
});

module.exports = new UsersController();
```

### Parameters

You will probably want to access data sent in by the user or other parameters in your controller actions. There are three kinds of parameters possible in a web application.

1. `req.query` The first are parameters that are sent as part of the URL, called query string parameters. The query string is everything after "?" in the URL.
2. `req.body` The second type of parameter is usually referred to as POST data. This information usually comes from an HTML form which has been filled in by the user. It's called POST data because it can only be sent as part of an HTTP POST request.
3. `req.params` The third are route parameters. Sometimes you will need to capture segments of the URI within your route.
  * For example, you may need to capture a user's ID from the URL. You may do so by defining route parameters: `routeMapper.get('/users/:id'...)`.
  * Route parameters always start with `:`

    ```javascript
      show : function(req, res, next) {
        User.query().where('id', req.params.id)...
      }
    ```


### Sessions

Your application has a session for each user in which you can store small amounts of data that will be persisted between requests. The session is only available in all middlewares and the views in the `req.session`

To enable sessions you need to:
* Install [Redis](http://redis.io/)
* Ensure `sessions` key in the `config.js` is not set to false for your environment
    ```javascript
    sessions : {
      key : 'some-key',
      secret : 's0m3-b4c0n'
    }
    ```


### The Flash

The flash is a special part of the session which is cleared with each request. This means that values stored there will only be available in the next request, which is useful for passing error messages etc.

`UsersController.js`
```javascript
create : function(req, res, next) {
  var user = new User(req.body);

  user.save().then(function() {
    req.flash('success', 'A user has been created.');
    res.redirect(urlFor.user(user.id));
  }).catch(next);
}
```

To access the flash object in the views:

```javascript
<%= flash.success %>
```

## Models and Migrations

### Migrations

Migrations are a convenient way to alter your database schema over time in a consistent and easy way. We choose [Knex](http://knexjs.org) tho handle this so that you don't have to write SQL by hand, allowing your schema and changes to be database independent.

The migration CLI is bundled with the knex install. To install globally, run:
```sh
$ npm install -g knex
```

Migrations use a `knexfile.js`, that is in the root directory of your application, which specify various configuration settings for the `knex` module.

Once you have edited the `knexfile.js`, you can use the migration tool to create migration files to the specified directory (default migrations). Creating new migration files can be achieved by running:

```sh
$ knex migrate:make migration_name
```

Read more on [Knex Documentation](http://knexjs.org/#Schema)

Once you have finished writing the migrations, you can update the database matching your NODE_ENV by running:

```sh
$ knex migrate:latest
```

You can also pass the --env flag or set NODE_ENV to select an alternative environment:

```sh
$ knex migrate:latest --env production

# or

$ NODE_ENV=production knex migrate:latest
```

To rollback the last batch of migrations:

```sh
$ knex migrate:rollback
```

### Models

We choose [Krypton-ORM](https://github.com/sgarza/krypton) to handle the model part of this MVC framework. The model is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic. `Krypton-ORM` facilitates the creation and use of business objects whose data requires persistent storage to a database.

Krypton-ORM:
* Is Opinionated
* Is Promised based
* Is Build on top of [Knex](http://knexjs.org)
* Has some ideas taken from [objection.js](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js) but simpler, like the relation eager loader.
* Implements Relations
  * HasOne
  * HasMany
  * HasManyThrough
* Implements ActiveRecord style hooks
  * beforeValidation
  * afterValidation
  * beforeSave
  * beforeCreate
  * beforeUpdate
  * afterCreate
  * afterUpdate
  * afterSave
  * beforeDestroy
  * afterDestroy

```javascript
User.query()
  .where('active', true)
  .andWhere('email', 'like', '%example.com%')
  .include('orders')
  .then(function(result) {
    ...
    // results are instances of User
  });
```

See more examples in [Krypton-ORM](https://github.com/sgarza/krypton) repo.

## Views or Templates

As you know, the Controller is responsible for orchestrating the whole process of handling a request, though it normally hands off any heavy code to the Model. But then, when it's time to send a response back to the user, the Controller hands things off to the View.

View files are [Thulium](https://github.com/freshout-dev/thulium/) templates with an .html extension and they go in the `/views` directory of your application.

You will use express response methods like `render` or `json` to send these views to the user.

```javascript
var UsersController = Class('UsersController').inherits(BaseController)({
  prototype : {
    new: function(req, res, next) {
      res.render('users/new.html');
    }
  }
});

module.exports = new UsersController();
```

Or the express response `json` method to send raw data instead of a view

```javascript
var UsersController = Class('UsersController').inherits(BaseController)({
  prototype : {
    all : function(req, res, next) {
      User.query().then(function(result) {
        res.json(result);
      });
    }
  }
});

module.exports = new UsersController();

```

Or combine them both

```javascript
var UsersController = Class('UsersController').inherits(BaseController)({
  prototype : {
    all : function(req, res, next) {
      res.format({
        html :  function() {
          User.query().then(function(result) {
            res.render('users/index.html', {users : result});
          });
        },
        json : function() {
          User.query().then(function(result) {
            res.json(result);
          });
        }
      });
    }
  }
});

module.exports = new UsersController();
```

As you can see `res.render` method auto prefix `/views/` to the template path. Also `res.render` second parameter is an object that contains the variables that the view will use, this parameter is optional.

Another way to pass variables or helper functions to the templates is in the `res.locals` object. Each time a template is rendered the `res.locals` object is merged to the `res.render` second parameter object.

```javascript
all : function(req, res, next) {
  User.query().then(function(result) {
    res.render('users/index.html', {users : result});
  });
}
```

Is the same as:

```javascript
all : function(req, res, next) {
  User.query().then(function(result) {
    res.locals.users = result;
    res.render('users/index.html');
  });
}
```

### Layouts

Layouts are a kind of template that is used to wrap other templates like the common header/footer method of wrapping views.

Layout templates go in `views/layouts/`

You tell the layout where to render other views with the `yield` keyword:

`views/layouts/application.html`
```html
<!doctype html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Title</title>
    <!-- webpack -d -->
    <script src="/dist/bundle.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
    <header>
    </header>
    <div class="container">
        <%= yield %>
    </div>
    <footer>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

The layout to use in any controller method/action is specified as another template's variable.
```javascript
res.render('users/show.html', { layout : 'application' })

// Or in a beforeAction that runs in all controller methods

var UsersController = Class('UsersController').inherits(BaseController)({
  beforeActions : [
    {
      before : [function(req, res, next) {
        res.locals.layout = 'users-layout'
        next()
      }],
      actions : ['index', 'show', 'new',, 'edit']
    }
  ],
  prototype : {
    index : function(req, res, next) {
      User.query().then(function(result) {
        res.render('users/index.html');
      });
    }
  }
});
```

### Partials

Partial templates are another device for breaking the rendering process into more manageable chunks.
To render a partial as part of a view, you use the renderPartial method within the view:

```html
<div>
  <%= renderPartial('users/_form.html') %>
</div>
```

You can also pass variables to the partial template:

```html
<div>
  <%= renderPartial('users/_form.html', {user : user}) %>
</div>

<!-- Or pass all the local context -->

<div>
  <%= renderPartial('users/_form.html', this) %>
</div>
```

## Contributing to Neonode

Neonode is not perfect, and it has bugs or incomplete features. You're welcome to tell us, or to contribute some code. This document describes details about how can you contribute to this project.

### Contribution guidelines

Depends on the situation, you will:

- Find a bug and create an issue
- Need more functionality and make a feature request
- Want to contribute code and open a pull request
- Run into issue and need help

### Bug Report

If you find something you consider a bug, please create a issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/sgarza/Neonode/issues). To avoid wasting time and reduce back-and-forth communication with team members, please include at least the following information in a form comfortable for you:

- Bug Description
- Neonode Version
- System Type
- Error Log
- Other information

Please take a moment to check that an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/sgarza/generator-neonode) doesn't already exist documenting your bug report or improvement proposal. If it does, it never hurts to add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too". This will help prioritize the most common problems and requests.

### Feature Request

There is no standard form of making a feature request. Just try to describe the feature as clearly as possible, because team members may not have experience with the functionality you're talking about.

### Pull Request

Pull requests are always welcome, but note that **ALL PULL REQUESTS MUST APPLY TO THE `development` BRANCH**.

We are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Do it! We will appreciate it.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged! If there's a problem with the implementation, hopefully you received feedback on what to improve.

We're trying very hard to keep Neonode lean and focused. We don't want it to do everything for everybody. This means that we will decide against incorporating a new feature.
